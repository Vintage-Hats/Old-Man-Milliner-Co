					<h2>Selecting and Wearing a Flat Cap</h2>
					<p>Flat caps, unlike the bolder fedora, make a softer statement that is easier and less intimidating to pair with a range of fall, winter and spring outfits. People like the flat cap because it’s still sporty, much like the baseball hat, but not too formal like a fedora. Before you run out and buy any old thing, read this guide.</p>

					<h3>What is a flat cap?</h3>
					<p>A flat cap is a rounded cap with soft fabric construction and a short, rounded front brim. There are two variations. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>A single-piece, flat construction of the body gives a level, trim silhouette. The body of the cap is pulled forward over the brim and is sewn or snapped to the top edge of the brim, creating a characteristic triangular side profile.</li>
						<li>A more voluminous construction of 8-triangular panels come together at the peak under a cloth-covered button. The body is pulled less forward than the single-piece forming a "bagger" sometimes almost tufted-looking body. Some call this version the newsboy.</li>
					<ul>
					<p>Other names for the flat cap include the cabbie cap, paddy cap, Gatsby cap, dai cap, longshoreman’s cap, scally cap, Wigens cap, ivy cap, derby cap, Jeff cap, duffer cap, duckbill cap, driving cap, bicycle cap, Irish cap, crook cap, sixpence, bunnet, cheese-cutter, Vergon hat, or Joao’s hat.</p>
					<p>A modern classic nonetheless, the flat cap's history goes back centuries. Men wore It’s predecessor, the “bonnet”, as early as the 14th century. The term “cap” came into use before the 17th century. In the 16th century, the British Parliament mandated that all non-noble men wear wool on Sunday's and holidays to stimulate wool consumption. Most Englishmen bought hats to meet the requirement affordably, making caps part of the "uniform" for the working man, well after the demise of the short-lived law. The cap continued to be popular through the 19th and 20th centuries. The aristocracy even adopted the flat cap, in more expensive materials, as a casual hat option for wear at their country estates. They often worn caps with tweed suits for hunting, stalking, and shooting. In the US and the UK, the flat cap and newsboy cap peaked in popularity in the 1910s and 1920s. The era did help popularize the term “newsboy” due to the boys who wore them when selling newspapers, but the hat was worn almost universally by the working class.</p>
					<p>Public figures, aristocrats, and royals continued to wear them for leisure activities. Recently, celebrities such as David Beckham and Brad Pitt have been seen wearing flat caps, raising their profile as an accessory for the modern man.</p>

					<h3>Select the correct hat.</h3>
					<p>Sized properly, they flatter nearly all face shapes and they can be styled to suit casual, informal and formal attire. It should fit like a baseball cap with a gentle snug around the sweatband. Leave extra room in the crown to avoid the fabric stretching tightly on top of your head.</p>

					<p>The fabric shell and sewn construction make the flat cap much easier to fit and less expensive to buy than other hats. The hatband and the brim create the structure of the hat, and it should fit comfortably across your forehead.</p>
					</p>Flat caps originally came in wool, tweed, and cotton. Stick with fabric and avoid non-traditional materials such as leather or denim. Choose a natural material composition since the addition of synthetic material makes it less warm and breathable. Avoid buying patchwork or multi-pattern caps. These fads come ing and out of style.</p>

					<h3>Never wear a flat cap backwards.</h3>
					<p>Just about every open mic night, a guy wears a backwards cap. Knock it off. Listen, the rich and famous do whatever they want (and really, only Samuel L Jackson pulls off that look). Until you join them, turn the hat around and wear it properly – forward.</p>

					<h3>Pick One</h3>
					<p>For your first flat cap, pick a really standard one. Herringbone stitch is timeless, classic, and matches everything. Then if you fall in love with the flat cap craze, you’re going to need to collect them all. There are so many varieties and different patterns, that you’ll be able to match any outfit with one. However, avoid hyper-matching. If your hat and shirt are the same exact color or print, it looks like you tried too hard. Too many steampunk accessories, like adding a  monocle, looks obnoxious. Go for the “I just threw this on my head and walked out,” sort of style. Don’t try too hard with flat caps, they already make a strong statement by themselves.</p>
					<p>With tweed caps, make sure that the material of your hat contrasts enough with the material of your coat or jacket. Patterns that are too similar will look odd next to each other, so consider a solid color for one and a pattern for the other.</p>
					<p>Shape the brim to your taste, if necessaary. Many caps come with a relatively flat brim, and you can round it gently (not too much!) to fit your head better and contour naturally around your face Don’t wear a flat cap unpinned or snapped; this configuration isn’t part of the original style, even if the snap is working, and it tends to be a more feminine look.</p>
