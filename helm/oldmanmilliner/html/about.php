						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>Great style doesn't go out of ... well, style. We pride ourselves on offering great hats for great times with friends,

							whatever it is you get up to.</p>
						<h3>History</h3>

						<p>Old Man Milliner Co. was founded in Kissimmee, Florida in 1952 by Donovan Milliner with the aspiration to make hats
							fit for princes but within reach of paupers. Overtime, the Milliner name became synonymous with style in the greater
							Orlando area. Whether it be a fitted Fedora for a night on the town or a fun Trilby for a day at the beach, everyone
							wore a Milliner original. Donovan used his success early on to fund classes for potential creators, from hat makers to
							hypermodernist artists, through the Milliner Creators' Foundation to support the wider creative community.</p>
							
						<p>Donovan Milliner died in 2008, but his legacy lives on for current and future generations due to his philanthropic
							efforts. He touched lives with his art ...  and hats!</p>
