					<h2>The History of Style</h2>

						<h3>Fedora</h3>
						<p>The superstar of the classic hat world, the Fedora rose to popularity during the Prohibition era of the United States where it earned a reputation for being a "gangsters" hat. This led to the Fedora’s golden age between the 1920s and the early 1950s. It remains the most iconic hat style in the western world. The fedora's popularity led to manufacturers to place the Fedora label on any hat that even resembling one. For the purest, a Fedora is a felt hat with pinched sides and a lengthwise crease down the crown giving the front a roughly wedge-like shape.</p>

						<h3>Trilby</h3>
						<p>The name Trilby came from the stage adaptation of George du Maurier's 1894 novel <i>Trilby</i> in which the cast wore them in its first London production. The Trilby reached the peak of its popularity in the 1960s. A Trilby resembles a Fedora but is a little shorter and more angular. They share crown shapes except the Trilby's crown angled to the back.</p>

						<h3>Homburg</h3>	
						<p>All business all the time, Brits first fell in love with the Homburg when, in the 1890s, Edward the VII brought it back from Hesse, Germany’s Bad Homburg district. At the 1953 inauguration, President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke with tradition wearing a Homburg instead of a top hat. He gave the Homburg a repeat performance at his second inauguration that took 3 months to make and was crafted by people in 10 separate countries (some calling it the "International Homburg"). The Homburg possesses the same creased crown as a Fedora but without the pinch at the sides. The Homburg brim is stiffer and slightly upturned lip all the way around. Many still see it as the go-to dress hat of the businessman, the politician and other "well-to-do" gentlemen in the western world.</p>

						<h3>Porkpie</h3>
						<p>The porkpie resembles an actual pork pie. During the Great Depression, the likes of Buster Keaton and Jazz musicians such as Lester Young made the hat fashionable. The Porkpie's features include flattened crown without a crease down the center and pinched sides like a Fedora. The brim is usually small, and turned up all around.</p>

						<h3>Bowler</h3>
						<p>Designed by London hat makers Thomas and William Bowler, no one is quite certain who commissioned the Bowler. Famous actors such as Charlie Chaplin and John Cleese made and keep the hat in vogue.  It even remains a part of the formal uniform of British law enforcement.</p>

						<h3>Flat Caps</h3>
						<p>Probably the most informal hat on this list, the Flat cap goes back to the 14th century and originated in Scotland where, originally, they called it a “bonnet” (and many still do). The flat cap's lengthy history continues full-steam across the western world and remains quite popular in US Cities. With a round rounded shape, a small brim, and a high back, it too possesses a wedge shape, but turned horizontal where the body of the hat comes foward and attaches to the front, or near the front, of the baseball-cap-like brim..</p>
