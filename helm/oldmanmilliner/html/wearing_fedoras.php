						<h2>Wearing Fedoras Well!</h2>

						<h3>Buy the hat that looks good on you, not the rack.</h3>
						<p>You might see a hat in the window of your local milliner that you fall in love with.  That doesn’t mean it’s a good hat on you.</p>
						<p>Just like short men shouldn’t wear long, double-breasted jackets, you hat needs to be chosen with regard to the shape of your head. If your head is long and thin, buying a hat with a tall crown will make you look like an alien.</p>
						<p>Likewise, if you have a more round, wide head, getting something with a really wide brim will make you look like you’re playing dress up and hunting vampires.</p>

						<h3>Sane colors only please.</h3>
						<p>If it’s anything other than black (which might make people think you’re an orthodox Jew), grey, olive, brown, navy, or tan, it’s a bad idea.</p>
						<p>Remember that when pairing hat color to jacket color they have to either match nearly perfectly or contrast to some degree.  A navy hat that’s two shades lighter than a navy jacket looks terrible, but a medium grey over that same jacket can look killer.</p>

						<h3>Wear it with confidence.</h3>
						<p>Stop worrying about your hat and just wear the damn thing. Put it on your head, and find an angle that looks good. As long as it’s not sitting perfectly evenly, you’re doing fine. If you aren’t confident, there’s a chance that the hat will wear you. If you hold your head up high and exude confidence, your classy style will be sure to turn heads.</p>

						<h3>Choose a fedora that matches your style.</h3>
						<p>Most fedoras are made of felt, but some are made of wool, fur or straw. Some fedoras have wide bands with decoration and others do not. Depending on your style and what you’re looking for in a hat, you’ll need to make some decisions.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you live in a warm climate, you might want to shy away from getting a wool fedora, so you don’t overheat. For warmer climates, consider getting a felt or straw fedora.</li>
							<li>If you’re more of a traditionalist, consider getting a classic fedora. A classic fedora is generally made of wool and will make you look just like the gangsters in old movies.</li>
							<li>If you have a smaller head, consider getting a pork-pie hat. This type of fedora has a smaller brim, so it will fit your face better.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Good hats look better with age, so the more frequently you wear your fedora, the better it will look. Also, the more times your wear your hat, the more people will associate you with your hat and the fedora will start to seem like your signature piece.</p>

						<h3>Wear your fedora on dressy occasions.</h3>
						<p>A wool fedora looks great with a suit and tie. Wearing a fedora is stylish way to look original and classy at a fancy event.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you don’t currently have a suit, you can buy one in most department stores, or at a thrift store. You can also borrow one from a friend who is a similar size as you.</li>
							<li>Wearing a fedora with your suit is appropriate for weddings, dances and other fancy parties. Avoid wearing a fedora at more solemn occasions, like funerals.</li>
							<li>If you have a little extra money, pay to have your suit professionally tailored. This will ensure your suit fits your body perfectly, which will perfectly accentuate your fedora.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Dress your fedora down.</h3>
						<p>To do this, pair your fedora with a tighter-fitting sweater, slacks and nice shoes (not sneakers). This is the perfect outfit to wear out to dinner or to a school dance. If you're going to dinner first, keep in mind that some restaurants will expect you to take off your hat indoors.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You can also swap the sweater out for a nice vest over a button down shirt.</li>
							<li>If you're wearing a sweater, don't wear a fedora made of straw. Those are considered warmer weather fedoras, and your hat will look odd with your outfit.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Wear your fedora with jeans.</h3>
						<p>Since the fedora is a dressy hat, you’ll need to dress up your outfit a little bit if you're going with jeans. Do this by pairing your jeans (which should be well-tailored) with a blazer or nice jacket.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Try adding a colorful or patterned button-down shirt under your jacket for a little pop of color and visual interest.</li>
							<li>If the colors of this outfit are fairly neutral, try mixing it up with a brightly colored fedora.</li>
							<li>This is a great outfit to wear while hanging out on the weekend or while traveling on vacation.</li>
						</ul>
