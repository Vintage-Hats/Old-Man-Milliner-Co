						<h2>Pork Pie vs. Fedora</h2>
						<p>The main differences between a pork pie and fedora appears in the crown and brim. For a porkpie hat, the top of the crown is pinched in and the crease is circular, often called a telescope crown. Plus, the brim is very short (or stingy brim) and curls up all the way around. Finally, the crown’s height tends to be shorter than a fedora's crown.</p>
						<p>Options for the shape of the crown's top include center dent, teardrop, diamond, cattleman and telescope. A fedora’s brim can up or down all the way around; or, it can point up in the back and shaped down in the front.</p>
